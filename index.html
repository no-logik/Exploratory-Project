        <h2 class="text-left">What is Mental Illness?</h2>
        <p>Mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination
          of
          these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family
          activities. Mental illness is common. In a given year:
        <ul>
          <li> Nearly one in five (19%) U.S. adults experience some form of mental illness..</li>
          <li>One in 24 (4.1%) has a serious mental illness*.</li>
          <li>One in 12 (8.5%) has a diagnosable substance use disorder.</li>
        </ul>
        Mental illness is treatable. The vast majority of individuals with mental illness continue to function in
        their daily lives. <br> A mental health condition isn’t the result of one event. Research suggests multiple,
        linking
        causes. Genetics, environment and lifestyle influence whether someone develops a mental health condition. A
        stressful job or home life makes some people more susceptible, as do traumatic life events. Biochemical
        processes and circuits and basic brain structure may play a role, too. <br>

        None of this means that you’re broken or that you, or your family, did something “wrong.” Mental illness is no
        one’s fault. And for many people, recovery — including meaningful roles in social life, school and work — is
        possible, especially when you start treatment early and play a strong role in your own recovery process.</p>

            <p>We all experience anxiety. For example, speaking in front of a group can make us anxious, but that
              anxiety also motivates us to prepare and practice. Driving in heavy traffic is another common source of
              anxiety, but it helps keep us alert and cautious to avoid accidents. However, when feelings of intense
              fear and distress become overwhelming and prevent us from doing everyday activities, an anxiety disorder
              may be the cause.</p>
            <p>Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health concern in the United States. Over 40 million adults
              in the U.S. (19.1%) have an anxiety disorder. Meanwhile, approximately 7% of
              children aged 3-17&nbsp;experience issues with anxiety each year.&nbsp;Most people develop symptoms before
              age 21.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Anxiety disorders are a group of related conditions, each having unique symptoms. However, all anxiety
              disorders have one thing in common: persistent, excessive fear or worry in situations that are not
              threatening. People typically experience one or more of the following symptoms:</p>
            <p>Emotional symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Feelings of apprehension or dread</li>
              <li>Feeling tense or jumpy</li>
              <li>Restlessness or irritability</li>
              <li>Anticipating the worst and being watchful for signs of danger</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Physical symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pounding or racing heart and shortness of breath</li>
              <li>Sweating, tremors and twitches</li>
              <li>Headaches, fatigue and insomnia</li>
              <li>Upset stomach, frequent urination or diarrhea</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Types of Anxiety Disorders</h2>
            <p>There are many types of anxiety disorders, each with different symptoms. The most common types of anxiety
              disorders include:</p>
            <h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</h3>
            <p>GAD produces chronic, exaggerated worrying about everyday life. This worrying can consume hours each day,
              making it hard to concentrate or finish daily tasks. A person with GAD may become exhausted by worry and
              experience headaches, tension or nausea.</p>
            <h3>Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
            <p>More than shyness, this disorder causes intense fear about social interaction, often driven by irrational
              worries about humiliation (e.g. saying something stupid or not knowing what to say). Someone with social
              anxiety disorder may not take part in conversations, contribute to class discussions or offer their ideas,
              and may become isolated. Panic attacks are a common reaction to anticipated or forced social interaction.
            </p>
            <h3>Panic Disorder</h3>
            <p>This disorder is characterized by panic attacks and sudden feelings of terror sometimes striking
              repeatedly and without warning. Often mistaken for a heart attack, a panic attack causes powerful physical
              symptoms including chest pain, heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and stomach upset. Many
              people will go to desperate measures to avoid an attack, including social isolation.</p>
            <h3>Phobias</h3>
            <p>We all tend to avoid certain things or situations that make us uncomfortable or even fearful. But for
              someone with a phobia, certain places, events or objects create powerful reactions of strong, irrational
              fear. Most people with specific phobias have several things that can trigger those reactions; to avoid
              panic, they will work hard to avoid their triggers. Depending on the type and number of triggers, attempts
              to control fear can take over a person&rsquo;s life.</p>
            <p>Other anxiety disorders include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Agoraphobia</li>
              <li>Selective mutism</li>
              <li>Separation anxiety disorder</li>
              <li>Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, involving intoxication or withdrawal or medication
                treatment</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Scientists believe that many factors combine to cause anxiety disorders:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.</strong>&nbsp; Studies support the evidence that anxiety disorders &ldquo;run in
                families,&rdquo; as some families have a higher-than-average amount of anxiety disorders among
                relatives.</li>
              <li><strong>Environment.&nbsp;</strong>A stressful or traumatic event such as abuse, death of a loved one,
                violence or prolonged illness is often linked to the development of an anxiety disorder.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Physical symptoms of an anxiety disorder can be easily confused with other medical conditions, like heart
              disease or hyperthyroidism. Therefore, a doctor will likely perform an evaluation&nbsp;involving a
              physical examination, an interview and lab tests. After ruling out an underlying physical illness, a
              doctor may refer a person to a mental health professional for evaluation.</p>
            <p>Using the&nbsp;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)&nbsp;a mental health
              professional is able to identify the specific type of anxiety disorder causing symptoms as well as any
              other possible disorders that may be involved. Tackling all disorders through comprehensive treatment is
              the best recovery strategy.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Different anxiety disorders have their own distinct sets of symptoms. This means that each type of
              anxiety disorder also has its own treatment plan. But there are common types of treatment that are
              used.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Psychotherapy,&nbsp;including cognitive behavioral therapy</li>
              <li>Medications,&nbsp;including antianxiety medications and antidepressants</li>
              <li>Complementary health approaches, including stress and relaxation techniques</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>Anxiety disorders can occur along with other mental health conditions, and they can often make related
              conditions worse. So, talk with a mental health care professional if you are experiencing anxiety and any
              of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>Substance Use</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD)</h1>
            <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition in which characterized by inattention,
              hyperactivity and impulsivity. ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in young people. An estimated 8.8% of
              children&nbsp;aged 4-<span style="line-height: 1.6;">17&nbsp;have ADHD. While ADHD is usually diagnosed in
                childhood, it does not only affect children. An estimated 4.4% of adults aged 18-44 have ADHD.</span>
            </p>
            <p>With treatment,&nbsp;people with ADHD can be successful in school, work and lead productive lives.
              Researchers are using new tools such as brain imaging to better understand the condition and to find more
              effective ways to treat and prevent ADHD.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>While some behaviors associated with ADHD are &quot;normal&quot; and not a cause for concern to most
              people, someone with ADHD will have trouble controlling these behaviors and will show them much more
              frequently and for longer than 6 months.</p>
            <p>Signs of inattention include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Becoming easily distracted, and jumping from activity to activity.</li>
              <li>Becoming bored with a task quickly.</li>
              <li>Difficulty focusing attention or completing a single task or activity.</li>
              <li>Trouble completing or turning in homework assignments.</li>
              <li>Losing things such as school supplies or toys.</li>
              <li>Not listening or paying attention when spoken to.</li>
              <li>Daydreaming or wandering with lack of motivation.</li>
              <li>Difficulty processing information quickly.</li>
              <li>Struggling to follow directions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Signs of hyperactivity include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fidgeting and squirming, having trouble sitting still.</li>
              <li>Non-stop talking.</li>
              <li>Touching or playing with everything.</li>
              <li>Difficulty doing quiet tasks or activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Signs of impulsivity include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Impatience.</li>
              <li>Acting without regard for consequences, blurting things out.</li>
              <li>Difficulty taking turns, waiting or sharing.</li>
              <li>Interrupting others.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>There are several factors believed to contribute to ADHD:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> Research shows that genes may be a large contributor to ADHD. ADHD often
                runs in families and some trends in specific brain areas that contribute to attention.</li>
              <li><strong>Environmental factors.</strong> Studies show a link between cigarette smoking and alcohol use
                during pregnancy and children who have ADHD. Exposure to lead as a child has also been shown to increase
                the likelihood of ADHD in children.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>ADHD occurs in both children and adults, but is most often and diagnosed in childhood. Getting a
              diagnosis for ADHD can sometimes be difficult because the symptoms of ADHD are similar to typical behavior
              in most young children. Teachers are often the first to notice ADHD symptoms because they see children in
              a learning environment with peers every day.</p>
            <p>There is no one single test that can diagnose a child with ADHD, so meet with a doctor or mental health
              professional to gather all the necessary information to make a diagnosis. The goal is to rule out any
              outside causes for symptoms, such as environmental changes, difficulty in school, medical problems and
              ensure that a child is otherwise healthy.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>ADHD is managed and treated in several&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">ways: </span></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Medications</strong>,</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">
                  including stimulants, nonstimulants and antidepressants</span></li>
              <li><strong><span style="line-height: 1.6;">Behavioral therapy</span></strong></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Self-management, education programs and assistance</strong>
                  through schools or work or alternative treatment approaches</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>Around two-thirds of children with ADHD also have another condition. Many adults are also
              impacted by the symptoms of another condition. Common conditions associated with ADHD include the
              following.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learning disabilities</li>
              <li>Oppositional defiant disorder: refusal to accept directions or authority from adults or others</li>
              <li>Conduct disorder, persistent destructive or violent behaviors</li>
              <li>Anxiety and
                depression</li>
              <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
              <li>Bipolar disorder</li>
              <li>Tourette&#39;s syndrome</li>
              <li>Sleep disorders</li>
              <li>Bed-wetting</li>
              <li>Substance use disorders/Dual Diagnosis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Symptoms from other conditions make treating ADHD more difficult. Talking to a skilled professional to
              help establish an accurate diagnosis can help increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Bipolar Disorder</h1>
            <p>Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes dramatic shifts in a person&rsquo;s mood, energy and
              ability to think clearly. People with bipolar experience high and low moods&mdash;known as mania and
              depression&mdash;which differ from the typical ups-and-downs most people experience.</p>
            <p>The average age-of-onset is about 25, but it can occur in the teens, or more uncommonly, in childhood.
              The condition affects men and women equally, with about 2.8%
              of the U.S. population diagnosed with bipolar disorder and nearly 83%
              of cases classified as severe.</p>
            <p>If left untreated, bipolar disorder usually worsens. However, with a good treatment plan including
              psychotherapy, medications, a healthy lifestyle, a regular schedule and early identification of symptoms,
              many people live well with the condition.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms and their severity can vary. A person with bipolar disorder may have distinct manic or depressed
              states but may also have extended periods&mdash;sometimes years&mdash;without symptoms. A person can also
              experience both extremes simultaneously or in rapid sequence.</p>
            <p>Severe bipolar episodes of mania or depression may include psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or
              delusions. Usually, these psychotic symptoms mirror a person&rsquo;s extreme mood. People with bipolar
              disorder who have psychotic symptoms can be wrongly diagnosed as having schizophrenia.</p>
            <p><strong>Mania.</strong>&nbsp;To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced at
              least one episode of mania or hypomania. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that doesn&rsquo;t include
              psychotic episodes. People with hypomania can often function well in social situations or at work. Some
              people with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania or hypomania many times throughout their life;
              others may experience them only rarely.</p>
            <p>Although someone with bipolar may find an elevated mood of mania appealing&mdash;especially if it occurs
              after depression&mdash;the &ldquo;high&rdquo; does not stop at a comfortable or controllable level. Moods
              can rapidly become more irritable, behavior more unpredictable and judgment more impaired. During periods
              of mania, people frequently behave impulsively, make reckless decisions and take unusual risks.</p>
            <p>Most of the time, people in manic states are unaware of the negative consequences of their actions. With
              bipolar disorder, suicide
              is an ever-present danger because some people become suicidal even in manic states. Learning from prior
              episodes what kinds of behavior signals &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; of manic behavior can help manage the
              symptoms of the illness.</p>
            <p><strong>Depression</strong>.&nbsp;The lows of bipolar depression are often so debilitating that people
              may be unable to get out of bed. Typically, people experiencing a depressive episode have difficulty
              falling and staying asleep, while others sleep far more than usual. When people are depressed, even minor
              decisions such as what to eat for dinner can be overwhelming. They may become obsessed with feelings of
              loss, personal failure, guilt or helplessness; this negative thinking can lead to thoughts of suicide.</p>
            <p>The depressive symptoms that obstruct a person&rsquo;s ability to function must be present nearly every
              day for a period of at least two weeks for a diagnosis. Depression associated with bipolar disorder may be
              more difficult to treat and require a customized treatment plan.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Scientists have not yet discovered a single cause of bipolar disorder. Currently, they believe several
              factors may contribute, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> The chances of developing bipolar disorder are increased if a child&rsquo;s
                parents or siblings have the disorder. But the role of genetics is not absolute: A child from a family
                with a history of bipolar disorder may never develop the disorder. Studies of identical twins have found
                that, even if one twin develops the disorder, the other may not.</li>
              <li><strong>Stress</strong>. A stressful event such as a death in the family, an illness, a difficult
                relationship, divorce or financial problems can trigger a manic or depressive episode. Thus, a
                person&rsquo;s handling of stress may also play a role in the development of the illness.</li>
              <li><strong>Brain structure</strong> <strong>and function</strong>. Brain scans cannot diagnose bipolar
                disorder, yet researchers have identified subtle differences in the average size or activation of some
                brain structures in people with bipolar disorder.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>To diagnose bipolar disorder, a doctor may perform a physical examination, conduct an interview and order
              lab tests. While bipolar disorder cannot be seen on a blood test or body scan, these tests can help rule
              out other illnesses that can resemble the disorder, such as hyperthyroidism. If no other illnesses (or
              medicines such as steroids) are causing the symptoms, the doctor may recommend mental health care.</p>
            <p>To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced at least one episode of mania or
              hypomania. Mental health care professionals use the&nbsp;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
              Disorders&nbsp;(DSM) to diagnose the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of bipolar disorder a person may be experiencing.
              To determine what type of bipolar disorder a person has, mental health care professionals assess the
              pattern of symptoms and how impaired the person is during their most severe episodes.</p>
            <h2>Four Types of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Bipolar I Disorder</strong>&nbsp;is an illness in which people have experienced one or more
                episodes of mania. Most people diagnosed with bipolar I will have episodes of both mania and depression,
                though an episode of depression is not necessary for a diagnosis. To be diagnosed with bipolar I, a
                person&rsquo;s manic episodes must last at least seven days or be so severe that hospitalization is
                required.</li>
              <br />
              <li value="2"><strong>Bipolar II Disorder</strong>&nbsp;is a subset of bipolar disorder in which people
                experience depressive episodes shifting back and forth with hypomanic episodes, but never a
                &ldquo;full&rdquo; manic episode.</li>
              <br />
              <li value="3"><strong>Cyclothymic Disorder or Cyclothymia</strong> is a chronically unstable mood state in
                which people experience hypomania and mild depression for at least two years. People with cyclothymia
                may have brief periods of normal mood, but these periods last less than eight weeks.</li>
              <br />
              <li value="4"><strong>Bipolar Disorder, &ldquo;other specified&rdquo; and
                  &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;is when a person does not meet the criteria for bipolar I, II
                or cyclothymia but has still experienced periods of clinically significant abnormal mood elevation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Bipolar disorder is treated and managed in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Psychotherapy</strong>,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;cognitive behavioral therapy and family-focused
                therapy.</li>
              <li><strong>Medications</strong>,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications and, to a
                lesser extent, antidepressants.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-management strategies</strong><em>, </em>like education and recognition of an
                episode&rsquo;s early symptoms.</li>
              <li><strong>Complementary health approaches</strong><em>,</em>&nbsp;such as aerobic exercise meditation,
                faith and prayer can support, but not replace, treatment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The largest research project to assess what treatment methods work for people with bipolar disorder is
              the Systematic
              Treatment Enhancement for Bipolar Disorder, otherwise known as Step-BD. Step-BD followed over 4,000
              people diagnosed with bipolar disorder over time with different treatments.</p>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>People with bipolar disorder can also experience:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anxiety</li>
              <li>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</li>
              <li>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
              </li>
              <li>Substance use disorders/dual
                diagnosis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>People with bipolar disorder and psychotic symptoms can be wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Bipolar
              disorder can
              be also misdiagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).
            </p>
            <p>These other illnesses and misdiagnoses can make it hard to treat bipolar disorder. For example, the
              antidepressants used to treat OCD and the stimulants used to treat ADHD may worsen symptoms of bipolar
              disorder and may even trigger a manic episode. If you have more than one condition (called co-occurring
              disorders), be sure to get a treatment plan that works for you.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Borderline Personality Disorder</h1>
            <p>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a condition characterized by difficulties regulating emotion.
              This means that people who experience BPD feel emotions intensely and for extended periods of time, and it
              is harder for them&nbsp;to return to a stable baseline&nbsp;after an emotionally triggering event.</p>
            <p>This difficulty can lead to impulsivity, poor self-image, stormy relationships and intense emotional
              responses to stressors. Struggling with self-regulation can also result in dangerous behaviors such as
              self-harm (e.g. cutting).</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s estimated that 1.4%
              of the adult U.S. population experiences BPD. Nearly 75% of people diagnosed with BPD are women. Recent
              research suggests that men may be equally affected by BPD, but are commonly misdiagnosed with PTSD or
              depression.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>People with BPD experience wide mood swings and can feel a great sense of instability and insecurity.
              According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnostic framework, some key signs and symptoms may
              include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment by friends and family.</li>
              <li>Unstable personal relationships that alternate between idealization (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so in
                love!&rdquo;) and devaluation (&ldquo;I hate her&rdquo;). This is also sometimes known as
                &quot;splitting.&quot;</li>
              <li>Distorted and unstable self-image, which affects moods, values, opinions, goals and relationships.
              </li>
              <li>Impulsive behaviors that can have dangerous outcomes, such as excessive spending, unsafe sex, reckless
                driving, or misuse or&nbsp;overuse of substances.</li>
              <li>Self-harming behavior including suicidal threats or attempts.</li>
              <li>Periods of intense depressed mood, irritability&nbsp;or anxiety lasting a few hours to a few days.
              </li>
              <li>Chronic feelings of boredom or emptiness.</li>
              <li>Inappropriate, intense or uncontrollable anger&mdash;often followed by shame and guilt.</li>
              <li>Dissociative feelings&mdash;disconnecting from your thoughts or sense of identity or &ldquo;out of
                body&rdquo; type of feelings&mdash;and stress-related&nbsp;paranoid thoughts. Severe cases of stress can
                also lead to brief psychotic episodes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The causes of BPD are not fully understood, but scientists agree that it is the result of a combination
              of factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> While no specific gene or gene profile has been shown to directly cause
                BPD, research suggests that people who have a close family member&nbsp;with BPD&nbsp;may be at a higher
                risk of developing the disorder.&nbsp;</li>
              <li><strong>Environmental factors.</strong> People who experience traumatic life events&mdash;such as
                physical or sexual abuse during childhood or neglect and separation from parents&mdash;are at increased
                risk of developing BPD.</li>
              <li><strong>Brain function.</strong> The emotional regulation system may be different in people with BPD,
                suggesting that there is a neurological basis for some of the symptoms. Specifically, the portions of
                the brain that control emotions and decision-making/judgment may not communicate optimally with one
                another.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>There is no definitive medical test to diagnose BPD, and a diagnosis is not based on one specific sign or
              symptom. BPD is best diagnosed by a mental health professional following a comprehensive clinical
              interview that may include talking with previous clinicians, reviewing previous medical evaluations and,
              when appropriate, interviews with friends and family.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>An effective treatment plan should include your preferences while also addressing any other co-existing
              conditions you may have. Examples of treatment options include psychotherapy; medications; and group, peer
              and family support. The overarching goal of treatment is for a person with BPD to increasingly self-direct
              their own treatment plan as they learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Psychotherapy&mdash;such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), cognitive
                behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy&mdash;is the first line of choice for BPD.
                Learning ways to cope with emotional dysregulation in a therapeutic setting is often the key to
                long-term improvement for those experiencing BPD.</li>
              <li>Medications may be instrumental to a treatment plan, but there is&nbsp;no
                one&nbsp;medication specifically made to treat the core symptoms of BPD. Rather, several medications can
                be used off-label to treat various symptoms.&nbsp;For example, mood stabilizers and antidepressants help
                with mood swings and dysphoria. And&nbsp;for some, low-dose antipsychotic medication may help control
                symptoms such as disorganized thinking.</li>
              <li><strong>Short-term hospitalization</strong> may be necessary during times of extreme stress,
                and/or&nbsp;impulsive or suicidal behavior to ensure safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>BPD can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and successful treatment includes addressing any other
              conditions a person might have. Many with BPD also experience additional conditions like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anxiety Disorders</li>
              <li>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</li>
              <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>Eating Disorders (notably bulimia nervosa)</li>
              <li>Substance Use&nbsp;Disorders / Dual Diagnosis</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">Depression</h1>
            <p>Depressive disorder, frequently referred to simply as depression, is more than just feeling sad or going
              through a rough patch. It&rsquo;s a serious mental health condition that requires understanding and
              medical
              care. Left untreated, depression can be devastating for those who have it and their families. Fortunately,
              with early detection, diagnosis and a treatment plan consisting of medication, psychotherapy and healthy
              lifestyle choices, many people can and do get better.</p>
            <p>Some will only experience one depressive episode in a lifetime, but for most, depressive disorder recurs.
              Without treatment, episodes may last a few months to several years.</p>
            <p>About 21&nbsp;million&nbsp;U.S. adults&mdash;8.4% of the population&mdash;had at least one major
              depressive episode in 2020.
              People
              of all ages and all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds experience depression, but it does affect
              some groups more than others.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Depression can present different symptoms, depending on the person. But for most people, depressive
              disorder changes how they function day-to-day, and typically for more than two weeks. Common symptoms
              include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Changes in sleep</li>
              <li>Changes in appetite</li>
              <li>Lack of concentration</li>
              <li>Loss of energy</li>
              <li>Lack of interest in activities</li>
              <li>Hopelessness or guilty thoughts</li>
              <li>Changes in movement (less activity or agitation)</li>
              <li>Physical aches and pains</li>
              <li>Suicidal thoughts</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Depression does not have a single cause. It can be triggered by a life crisis, physical illness or
              something else&mdash;but it can also occur spontaneously. Scientists believe several factors can
              contribute
              to depression:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Trauma</strong>. When people experience trauma at an early age, it can cause long-term changes
                in how their brains respond to fear and stress. These changes may lead to depression.</li>
              <li><strong>Genetics</strong>. Mood disorders, such as depression, tend to run in families.</li>
              <li><strong>Life circumstances</strong>. Marital status, relationship changes, financial standing and
                where
                a person lives influence whether a person develops depression.</li>
              <li><strong>Brain changes</strong>. Imaging studies have shown that the frontal lobe of the brain becomes
                less active when a person is depressed. Depression is also associated with changes in how the pituitary
                gland and hypothalamus respond to hormone stimulation.</li>
              <li><strong>Other medical conditions</strong>. People who have a history of sleep disturbances, medical
                illness, chronic pain, anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to
                develop depression. Some medical syndromes (like hypothyroidism) can mimic depressive disorder. Some
                medications can also cause symptoms of depression.</li>
              <li><strong>Drug and alcohol misuse</strong>. Adults with a substance use disorder are at significantly
                higher risk for experiencing a major depressive episode.&nbsp;Co-occurring disorders
                require&nbsp;coordinated treatment for both conditions, as alcohol can worsen depressive symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>To be diagnosed with depressive disorder, a person must have experienced a depressive episode lasting
              longer than two weeks. The symptoms of a depressive episode include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Loss of interest or loss of pleasure in all activities</li>
              <li>Change in appetite or weight&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Sleep disturbances</li>
              <li>Feeling agitated or feeling slowed down</li>
              <li>Fatigue</li>
              <li>Feelings of low self-worth, guilt or shortcomings</li>
              <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
              <li>Suicidal thoughts or intentions</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Treatments</h2>
            <p>Although depressive disorder can be a devastating illness, it often responds to treatment. The key is to
              get a specific evaluation and treatment plan. Safety planning is important for individuals who have
              suicidal
              thoughts. After an assessment rules out medical and other possible causes, a patient-centered treatment
              plans can include any or a combination of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Psychotherapy</strong>&nbsp;including cognitive behavioral therapy, family-focused therapy and
                interpersonal therapy.</li>
              <li><strong>Medications</strong> including antidepressants, mood stabilizers and antipsychotic
                medications.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Exercise </strong>can help with prevention and mild-to-moderate symptoms.</li>
              <li><strong>Brain stimulation therapies</strong> can be tried if psychotherapy and/or medication are not
                effective. These include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for depressive disorder with psychosis or
                repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for severe depression.</li>
              <li><strong>Light therapy</strong>, which uses a light box to expose a person to full spectrum light in an
                effort to regulate the hormone melatonin.</li>
              <li><strong>Alternative approaches</strong> including acupuncture, meditation, faith and nutrition can be
                part of a comprehensive treatment plan.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="text-center">Dissociative Disorder</h1>
            <p>Dissociative disorders are characterized by an involuntary escape from reality characterized by a
              disconnection between thoughts, identity, consciousness and memory. People from all age groups and racial,
              ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds can experience a dissociative disorder.</p>
            <p>Up to 75% of
              people&nbsp;experience at least one depersonalization/derealization episode in their lives, with only 2%
              meeting the full criteria for
              chronic episodes. Women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with a&nbsp;dissociative disorder.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>The symptoms of a dissociative disorder usually first develop as a response to a traumatic event, such as
              abuse or military combat, to keep those memories under control. Stressful situations can worsen symptoms
              and
              cause problems with functioning in everyday activities. However, the symptoms a person experiences will
              depend on the type of dissociative disorder that a person has.</p>
            <p>Treatment for dissociative disorders often involves psychotherapy and medication. Though finding an
              effective treatment plan can be difficult, many people are able to live healthy and productive lives.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms and signs of dissociative disorders include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Significant memory loss of specific times, people and events</li>
              <li>Out-of-body experiences, such as feeling as though you are watching a movie of yourself</li>
              <li>Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and thoughts of suicide</li>
              <li>A sense of detachment from your emotions, or emotional numbness</li>
              <li>A lack of a sense of self-identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The symptoms of dissociative disorders depend on the type of disorder that has been diagnosed. There are
              three types of dissociative disorders defined in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
                Disorders</em> (DSM):</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Dissociative Amnesia.</strong> The main symptom is difficulty remembering important
                information
                about one&rsquo;s self. Dissociative amnesia may surround a particular event, such as combat or abuse,
                or
                more rarely, information about identity and life history. The onset for an amnesic episode is usually
                sudden, and an episode can last minutes, hours, days, or, rarely, months or years. There is no average
                for
                age onset or percentage, and a person may experience multiple episodes throughout her life.</li>
              <li><strong>Depersonalization disorder. </strong>This disorder involves ongoing feelings of detachment
                from
                actions, feelings, thoughts and sensations as if they are watching a movie (depersonalization).
                Sometimes
                other people and things may feel like people and things in the world around them are unreal
                (derealization). A person may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms can last
                just
                a matter of moments or return at times over the years. The average onset age is 16, although
                depersonalization episodes can start anywhere from early to mid childhood. Less than 20% of people with
                this disorder start experiencing episodes after the age of 20.</li>
              <li><strong>Dissociative identity disorder.&nbsp;</strong>Formerly known as multiple personality disorder,
                this disorder is characterized by alternating between multiple identities. A person may feel like one or
                more voices are trying to take control in their head. Often these identities may have unique names,
                characteristics, mannerisms and voices. People with DID will experience gaps in memory of every day
                events, personal information and trauma. Women are more likely to be diagnosed, as they more frequently
                present with acute dissociative symptoms. Men are more likely to deny symptoms and trauma histories, and
                commonly exhibit more violent behavior, rather than amnesia or fugue states. This can lead to elevated
                false negative diagnosis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Dissociative disorders usually develop as a way of dealing with trauma. Dissociative disorders most often
              form in children exposed to long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Natural disasters and combat
              can
              also cause dissociative disorders.</p>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Doctors diagnose dissociative disorders based on a review of symptoms and personal history. A doctor may
              perform tests to rule out physical conditions that can cause symptoms such as memory loss and a sense of
              unreality (for example, head injury, brain lesions or tumors, sleep deprivation or intoxication). If
              physical causes are ruled out, a mental health specialist is often consulted to make an evaluation.</p>
            <p>Many features of dissociative disorders can be influenced by a person&rsquo;s cultural background. In the
              case of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative amnesia, patients may present with unexplained,
              non-epileptic seizures, paralyses or sensory loss. In settings where possession is part of cultural
              beliefs,
              the fragmented identities of a person who has DID may take the form of spirits, deities, demons or
              animals.
              Intercultural contact may also influence the characteristics of other identities. For example, a person in
              India exposed to Western culture may present with an &ldquo;alter&rdquo; who only speaks English. In
              cultures with highly restrictive social conditions, amnesia is frequently triggered by severe
              psychological
              stress such as conflict caused by oppression. Finally, voluntarily induced states of depersonalization can
              be a part of meditative practices prevalent in many religions and cultures, and should not be diagnosed as
              a
              disorder.</p>
            <h2><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>
            <p>Dissociative disorders are managed through various therapies including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong style="font-size:14px;">Psychotherapies </strong>such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
                and
                dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)</li>
              <li><strong style="font-size:14px;">Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing</strong> (EMDR)</li>
              <li>​<strong>Medications</strong> such as antidepressants can treat symptoms of related
                conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>Because dissociative disorders appear on the trauma spectrum, many patients may have conditions
              associated
              with trauma, as well as additional trauma-based conditions.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
              <li>Borderline personality disorder (BPD)</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">Eating Disorders</h1>
            <p>When you become so preoccupied with food and weight issues that you find it harder and harder to focus on
              other aspects of your life, it may be an early sign of an eating disorder. Without treatment, eating
              disorders can take over a person&rsquo;s life and lead to serious, potentially fatal medical
              complications.
              Eating disorders can affect people of any age or gender, but rates are higher among women.&nbsp;Symptoms
              commonly appear in adolescence and young adulthood.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Eating disorders are a group of related conditions that cause serious emotional and physical problems.
              Each
              condition involves extreme food and weight issues; however, each has unique symptoms that separate it from
              the others.</p>
            <p><strong>Anorexia Nervosa. </strong>People with anorexia will deny themselves food to the point of
              self-starvation as they obsesses about weight loss. With anorexia, a person will deny hunger and refuse to
              eat, practice binge eating and purging behaviors or exercise to the point of exhaustion as they attempts
              to
              limit, eliminate or &ldquo;burn&rdquo; calories.</p>
            <p>The emotional symptoms of anorexia include irritability, social withdrawal, lack of mood or emotion, not
              able to understand the seriousness of the situation, fear of eating in public and obsessions with food and
              exercise. Often food rituals are developed or whole categories of food are eliminated from the
              person&rsquo;s diet, out of fear of being &ldquo;fat&quot;.</p>
            <p>Anorexia can take a heavy physical toll. Very low food intake and inadequate nutrition causes a person to
              become very thin. The body is forced to slow down to conserve energy causing irregularities or loss of
              menstruation, constipation and abdominal pain, irregular heart rhythms, low blood pressure, dehydration
              and
              trouble sleeping. Some people with anorexia might also use binge eating and purge behaviors, while others
              only restrict eating.</p>
            <p><strong>Bulimia Nervosa.</strong> People living with bulimia will feel out of control when binging on
              very
              large amounts of food during short periods of time, and then desperately try to rid themselves of the
              extra
              calories using forced vomiting, abusing laxatives or excessive exercise. This becomes a repeating cycle
              that
              controls many aspects of the person&rsquo;s life and has a very negative effect both emotionally and
              physically. People living with bulimia are usually normal weight or even a bit overweight.</p>
            <p>The emotional symptoms of bulimia include low self-esteem overly linked to body image, feelings of being
              out of control, feeling guilty or shameful about eating and withdrawal from friends and family.</p>
            <p>Like anorexia, bulimia will inflict physical damage. The binging and purging can severely harm the parts
              of
              the body involved in eating and digesting food, teeth are damaged by frequent vomiting, and acid reflux is
              common. Excessive purging can cause dehydration that effect the body&rsquo;s electrolytes and leads to
              cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and even death.</p>
            <p><strong>Binge Eating Disorder (BED).</strong> A person with BED losses control over their eating and eats
              a
              very large amount of food in a short period of time. They may also eat large amounts of food even when he
              isn&#39;t hungry or after he is uncomfortably full. This causes them to feel embarrassed, disgusted,
              depressed or guilty about their behavior. A person with BED, after an episode of binge eating, does not
              attempt to purge or exercise excessively like someone living with anorexia or bulimia would. A person with
              binge eating disorder may be normal weight, overweight or obese.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Eating disorders are very complex conditions, and scientists are still learning about the causes.
              Although
              eating disorders all have food and weight issues in common, most experts now believe that eating disorders
              are caused by people attempting to cope with overwhelming feelings and painful emotions by controlling
              food.
              Unfortunately, this will eventually damage a person&rsquo;s physical and emotional health, self-esteem and
              sense of control.</p>
            <p>Factors that may be involved in developing an eating disorder include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> People with first degree relatives, siblings or parents, with an eating
                disorder appear to be more at risk of developing an eating disorder, too. This suggests a genetic link.
                Evidence that the brain chemical, serotonin, is involved also points a contributing genetic and
                biological
                factors.</li>
              <li><strong>Environment.</strong> Cultural pressures that idealize a particular body type place&nbsp;undue
                pressure on people to&nbsp;achieve unrealistic standards. Popular culture and media images often tie
                thinness (for women) or muscularity (for men)&nbsp;to popularity, success, beauty and happiness.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li><strong>Peer Pressure.</strong> With young people, this can be a very powerful force.
                Pressure&nbsp;can
                appear in the form of teasing, bullying or ridicule because of size or weight. A history of physical or
                sexual abuse can also contribute to some people developing an eating disorder.</li>
              <li><strong>Emotional Health.</strong> Perfectionism, impulsive behavior and difficult relationships can
                all
                contribute to lowering a person&rsquo;s self-esteem and make them vulnerable to developing eating
                disorders.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Eating disorders affect all types of people. However there are certain risk factors that put some people
              at
              greater risk for developing an eating disorder.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Age.</strong> Eating disorders are much more common during teens and early 20s.</li>
              <li><strong>Gender. </strong>Women and girls are more likely to have a&nbsp;diagnosed eating disorder.
                However, it is important to recognize that men and boys may be under-diagnosed due to differences in
                seeking treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
              <li><strong>Family history.</strong> Having a parent or sibling with an eating disorder increases the
                risk.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Dieting.</strong> Dieting taken too far can become an eating disorder.</li>
              <li><strong>Changes. </strong>Times of change like going to college, starting a new job, or getting
                divorced
                may be a stressor towards developing an eating disorder.</li>
              <li><strong>Vocations and activities.</strong> Eating disorders are especially common among gymnasts,
                runners, wrestlers and dancers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>A person with an eating disorder will have the best recovery outcome if they receive an early diagnosis.
              If
              an eating disorder is believed to an issue, a doctor will usually perform a physical examination, conduct
              an
              interview and order lab tests. These will help form the diagnosis and check for related medical issues and
              complications.</p>
            <p>In addition, a mental health professional will conduct a psychological evaluation. They may ask questions
              about eating habits, behaviors and beliefs. There may be questions about a patient&#39;s history of
              dieting,
              exercise, bingeing and purging.</p>
            <p>Symptoms must meet the criteria in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>
              (DSM)
              in order to warrant a diagnosis. Each eating disorder has its own diagnostic criteria that a mental health
              professional will use to determine which disorder is involved. It is not necessary to have all the
              criteria
              for a disorder to benefit from working with a mental health professional on food and eating issues.</p>
            <p>Often a person with an eating disorder will have symptoms of another mental health condition that
              requires
              treatment. Whenever possible, it is best to identified and address all conditions at the same time. This
              gives a person comprehensive treatment support that helps insure a lasting recovery.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Eating disorders are managed using a variety of techniques. Treatments will vary depending on the type of
              disorder, but will generally include the following.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Psychotherapy,</strong> such
                as talk therapy or behavioral therapy.</li>
              <li><strong>Medicine,</strong>
                such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs. Many people living with an eating disorder often have a
                co-occurring illness like depression or anxiety, and while there is no medication available to treat
                eating disorders themselves, many patients find that these medicines help with underlying issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Nutritional counseling and weight restoration monitoring</strong> are also
                crucial. Family-based treatment is especially important for families with children and adolescents
                because
                it enlists the families&rsquo; help to better insure healthy eating patterns, and increases awareness
                and
                support.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>People with eating disorders often have additional illnesses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>Anxiety disorders </li>
              <li>Borderline personality disorder</li>
              <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
              <li>Substance use disorders/ Dual Diagnosis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Treating these illnesses can help make treating an eating disorder easier. Some of the symptoms of eating
              disorders may be caused by another ilnesss.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Obsessive-Copulsive Disorder (OCD)</h1>
            <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts
              (obsessions) and irrational, excessive urges to do certain actions (compulsions). Although people with OCD
              may know that their thoughts and behavior don&#39;t make sense, they are often unable to stop them.</p>
            <p>Symptoms typically begin during childhood, the teenage years or young adulthood, although males often
              develop them at a younger age than females. 1.2% of U.S. adults experience OCD each year.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Most people have occasional obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors. In an obsessive-compulsive
              disorder, however, these symptoms generally last more than an hour each day and interfere with daily life.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Obsessions</strong> are intrusive, irrational thoughts or impulses that repeatedly occur. People
              with these disorders know these thoughts are irrational but are afraid that somehow they might be true.
              These thoughts and impulses are upsetting, and people may try to ignore or suppress them.</p>
            <p>Examples of obsessions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Thoughts about harming or having harmed someone</li>
              <li>Doubts about having done something right, like turning off the stove or locking a door</li>
              <li>Unpleasant sexual images</li>
              <li>Fears of saying or shouting inappropriate things in public</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Compulsions</strong> are repetitive acts that temporarily relieve the stress brought on by an
              obsession. People with these disorders know that these rituals don&#39;t make sense but feel they must
              perform them to relieve the anxiety and, in some cases, to prevent something bad from happening. Like
              obsessions, people may try not to perform compulsive acts but feel forced to do so to relieve anxiety.</p>
            <p>Examples of compulsions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hand washing due to a fear of germs</li>
              <li>Counting and recounting money because a person is can&#39;t be sure they added correctly</li>
              <li>Checking to see if a door is locked or the stove is off</li>
              <li>&quot;Mental checking&quot; that goes with intrusive thoughts is also a form of compulsion</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder&nbsp;is unknown, but researchers believe that activity
              in
              several portions of the brain is responsible. More specifically, these areas of the brain may not respond
              normally to serotonin, a chemical that some nerve cells use to communicate with each other. Genetics are
              thought to be very important. If you, your parent or a sibling, have&nbsp;obsessive-compulsive disorder,
              there&#39;s around a&nbsp;25%
              chance that another immediate family member will have it.</p>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>A doctor or mental health care professional will make a diagnosis of OCD. A general physical with blood
              tests is recommended to make sure the symptoms are not caused by illicit drugs, medications, another
              mental
              illness, or by a general medical condition. The sudden appearance of symptoms in children or older people
              merits a thorough medical evaluation to ensure that another illness is not causing of these symptoms.</p>
            <p>To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have must have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Obsessions, compulsions or both</li>
              <li>Obsessions or compulsions that are upsetting and cause difficulty with work, relationships, other
                parts
                of life and typically last for at least an hour each day</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>A typical treatment plan will often include both psychotherapy and medications, and combined treatment is
              usually optimal.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Medication</strong>, especially a type of antidepressant called a
                selective
                serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is helpful for many people to reduce the obsessions and
                compulsions.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is
                also
                helpful in relieving obsessions and compulsions. In particular,cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and
                exposure and response therapy (ERT) are effective for many people. Exposure response prevention therapy
                helps a person tolerate the anxiety associated with obsessive thoughts while not acting out a compulsion
                to reduce that anxiety. Over time, this leads to less anxiety and more self-mastery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Though OCD cannot be cured, it can be treated effectively. Read more on our treatment page.</p>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>There are related conditions that share some characteristics with OCD but are considered separate
              conditions.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Body Dysmorphic Disorder.</strong> This disorder is characterized by an obsession with
                physical
                appearance. Unlike simple vanity, BDD is characterized by obsessing over one&#39;s appearance and body
                image, often for many hours a day. Any perceived flaws cause significant distress and ultimately impede
                on
                the person&#39;s ability to function. In some extreme cases, BDD can lead to bodily injury either due to
                infection because of skin picking, excessive exercise, or from having unnecessary surgical procedures to
                change one&rsquo;s appearance.</li>
              <li><strong>Hoarding Disorder.</strong> This disorder is defined by the drive to collect a large amount of
                useless or valueless items, coupled with extreme distress at the idea of throwing anything away. Over
                time, this situation can render a space unhealthy or dangerous to be in. Hoarding disorder can
                negatively
                impact someone emotionally, physically, socially and financially, and often leads to distress and
                disability. In addition, many hoarders cannot see that their actions are potentially harmful, and so may
                resist diagnosis or treatment.</li>
              <li><strong>Trichotillomania.</strong> Many people
                develop unhealthy habits such as nail biting or teeth grinding, especially during periods of high
                stress.
                Trichotillomania, however, is the compulsive urge to pull out (and possibly eat) your own hair,
                including
                eyelashes and eyebrows. Some people may consciously pull out their hair, while others may not even be
                aware that they are doing it. Trichotillomania can create serious injuries, such as repetitive motion
                injury in the arm or hand, or, if the hair is repeatedly swallowed, the formation of hairballs in the
                stomach, which can be life threatening if left untreated. A similar illness is excoriation disorder,
                which
                is the compulsive urge to scratch or pick at the skin.</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h1>
            <p>Traumatic events&mdash;such as an accident, assault, military combat or natural disaster&mdash;can have
              lasting effects on a person&rsquo;s mental health. While many people will have short term responses to
              life-threatening events, some will develop longer term symptoms that can lead to a diagnosis of
              Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD symptoms often co-exist with other conditions such as substance
              use disorders, depression and anxiety. A comprehensive medical evaluation resulting in an individualized
              treatment plan is optimal.</p>
            <p>PTSD affects 3.6% of the U.S. adult population&mdash;about 9&nbsp;million individuals. About 37% of those
              diagnosed
              with PTSD are classified as having severe symptoms. Women are significantly more likely to experience PTSD
              than men.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>A diagnosis of PTSD requires a discussion with a trained professional. Symptoms of PTSD generally fall
              into
              these broad categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Re-experiencing type symptoms</strong><em>,</em> such as recurring, involuntary and intrusive
                distressing memories, which can include flashbacks of the trauma, bad dreams and intrusive thoughts.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Avoidance</strong>, which can include staying away from certain places or objects that are
                reminders of the traumatic event. A person might actively avoid a place or person that might activate
                overwhelming symptoms.</li>
              <li><strong>Cognitive and mood symptoms</strong>, which can include trouble recalling the event, negative
                thoughts about one&rsquo;s self. A person may also feel numb, guilty, worried or depressed and have
                difficulty remembering the traumatic event. Cognitive symptoms can in some instances extend to include
                out-of-body experiences or feeling that the world is &quot;not real&quot; (derealization).</li>
              <li><strong>Arousal symptoms</strong><em>,</em> such as hypervigilance. Examples might include being
                intensely startled by stimuli that resembles the trauma, trouble sleeping or outbursts of anger.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Young children can also develop PTSD, and the symptoms are different from those of adults. (This recent
              recognition by the field is a major step forward and research is ongoing.) Young children lack the ability
              to convey some aspects of their experience. Behavior (e.g. clinging to parents) is often a better clue
              than
              words, and developmental achievements in an impacted child might slip back (e.g. reversion to not being
              toilet trained in a 4-year-old).</p>
            <p>It is essential that a child be assessed by a professional who is skilled in the developmental responses
              to
              stressful events. A pediatrician or child mental health clinician can be a good start.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>PTSD can occur at any age and is directly associated with exposure to trauma. Adults and children who
              have
              PTSD represent a relatively small portion of those who have been exposed to trauma. This difference is not
              yet well understood but we do know that there are risk factors that can increase a person&rsquo;s
              likelihood
              to develop PTSD. Risk factors can include &nbsp;prior experiences of trauma, and factors that may promote
              resilience, such as social support. This is also an ongoing area of research.</p>
            <p>We do know that for some, our &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; biological instincts, which can be
              life-saving
              during a crisis, can leave us with ongoing symptoms. Because the body is busy increasing its heart rate,
              pumping blood to muscles, preparing the body to fight or flee, all our physical resources and energy are
              focused on getting out of harm&rsquo;s way. Therefore, there has been discussion that the posttraumatic
              stress response may not a disorder per se, but rather a variant of a human response to trauma.</p>
            <p>Whether you think of these symptoms as a stress response variant or PTSD, consider them a consequence of
              our body&rsquo;s inability to effectively return to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in the months after its
              extraordinary response to a traumatic event.</p>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of PTSD usually begin within three months after experiencing or being exposed to a traumatic
              event. Occasionally, symptoms may emerge years afterward. For a diagnosis of PTSD, symptoms must last more
              than one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety or substance use often accompany PTSD.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Though PTSD cannot be cured, it can be treated and managed in several ways.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Psychotherapy,
                such as cognitive processing therapy or group therapy</li>
              <li>Medications</li>
              <li>Self-management strategies, such as self-soothing and mindfulness, are helpful to
                ground a person and bring her back to reality after a flashback</li>
              <li>Service animals, especially dogs, can help soothe some of the symptoms of PTSD</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>Someone with PTSD may have additional disorders, as well as thoughts of or attempts at suicide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anxiety Disorders</li>
              <li>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</li>
              <li>Borderline Personality Disorder</li>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>Substance&nbsp;use disorders / Dual Diagnosis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These other illnesses can make it challenging to treat PTSD. For example, medications used to treat OCD
              or
              depression may worsen symptoms of PTSD. Successfully treating PTSD almost always improves these related
              illnesses and successful treatment of depression, anxiety or substance use usually improves PTSD symptoms.

            <h1 class="text-center">Psychosis</h1>
            <p>Most people think of psychosis as a break with reality. In a way it is. Psychosis is characterized as
              disruptions to a person&rsquo;s thoughts and perceptions that make it difficult for them to recognize what
              is real and what isn&rsquo;t. These disruptions are often experienced as seeing, hearing and believing
              things that aren&rsquo;t real or having strange, persistent thoughts, behaviors and emotions. While
              everyone&rsquo;s experience is different, most people say psychosis is frightening and confusing.</p>
            <p>Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness, and it is more common than you may think. In the U.S.,
              approximately 100,000 young people experience psychosis each year. As many as 3 in 100 people will have an
              episode at some point in their lives.</p>
            <p>Early or first-episode psychosis (FEP)&nbsp;refers to when a person first shows signs of beginning to
              lose
              contact with reality.&nbsp;Acting quickly to connect a person with the right treatment during early
              psychosis or FEP can be life-changing and radically alter that person&rsquo;s future. Don&rsquo;t wait to
              take the first step and prepare yourself with information by reviewing these tip sheets:&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <h3>Early warning signs before psychosis</h3>
            <p>Early psychosis or FEP rarely comes suddenly. Usually, a person has gradual, non-specific changes in
              thoughts and perceptions, but doesn&#39;t understand&nbsp;what&#39;s going on.&nbsp;Early warning signs
              can
              be difficult to distinguish from typical teen or young adult behavior. While such signs should not be
              cause
              for alarm, they may indicate the need to get an assessment from a doctor.</p>
            <p>Encouraging people to seek help for early psychosis is important.&nbsp;Families are often the first to
              see
              early signs of psychosis and the first to address the issue of seeking treatment. However, a person&#39;s
              willingness to accept help is often complicated by delusions, fears, stigma and feeling unsettled. In this
              case, families can find the situation extremely difficult, but there are engagement strategies to help
              encourage a person to seek help.</p>
            <p>It&#39;s important to get help quickly since early treatment provides the best hope of recovery by
              slowing,
              stopping and possibly reversing the effects of psychosis. Early warning signs include the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A worrisome drop in grades or job performance</li>
              <li>Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating</li>
              <li>Suspiciousness or uneasiness with others</li>
              <li>A decline in self-care or personal hygiene</li>
              <li>Spending a lot more time alone than usual</li>
              <li>Strong, inappropriate emotions or having no feelings at all</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Signs of early or first-episode psychosis</h3>
            <p>Determining exactly when the first episode of psychosis begins can be hard, but these signs and symptoms
              strongly indicate an episode of psychosis:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hearing, seeing, tasting or believing things that others don&rsquo;t</li>
              <li>Persistent, unusual thoughts or beliefs that can&rsquo;t be set aside regardless of what others
                believe
              </li>
              <li>Strong and inappropriate emotions or no emotions at all</li>
              <li>Withdrawing from family or friends</li>
              <li>A sudden decline in self-care</li>
              <li>Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such warning signs often point to a person&rsquo;s deteriorating health, and a physical and neurological
              evaluation can help find the problem. A mental health professional performing a psychological evaluation
              can
              determine if a mental health condition is involved and discuss next steps. If the psychosis is a symptom
              of
              a mental health condition, early action helps to keep lives on track.</p>
            <h3>Psychosis</h3>
            <p>Psychosis includes a range of symptoms but typically involves one of these two major experiences:</p>
            <p><strong>Hallucinations</strong>&nbsp;are seeing, hearing or&nbsp;feeling things that aren&rsquo;t there,
              such as the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hearing voices (auditory hallucinations)</li>
              <li>Strange sensations or unexplainable feelings</li>
              <li>Seeing glimpses of objects or people that are not there or distortions</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Delusions</strong>&nbsp;are strong beliefs that are not consistent with the person&rsquo;s
              culture,
              are unlikely to be true and may seem irrational to others, such as the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Believing external forces are controlling thoughts, feelings and behaviors</li>
              <li>Believing that trivial remarks, events or objects have personal meaning or significance</li>
              <li>Thinking you have special powers, are on a special mission or even that you are God.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>We are still learning about how and why psychosis develops, but several factors are likely involved. We
              do
              know that teenagers and young adults are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of psychosis because
              of hormonal changes in their brain during puberty.</p>
            <p>Several factors that can contribute to psychosis:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.&nbsp;</strong>Many genes can contribute&nbsp;to&nbsp;the development of psychosis,
                but
                just because a person has a gene doesn&rsquo;t mean they will experience psychosis. Ongoing studies will
                help&nbsp;us&nbsp;better understand which genes play a role in psychosis.</li>
              <li><strong>Trauma.</strong>&nbsp;A traumatic event such as a death, war or sexual assault can trigger a
                psychotic episode. The type of trauma&mdash;and a person&rsquo;s age&mdash;affects whether a traumatic
                event will result in psychosis.</li>
              <li><strong>Substance use.&nbsp;</strong>The use of marijuana, LSD, amphetamines and other substances can
                increase the risk of psychosis in people who are already vulnerable.</li>
              <li><strong>Physical illness or injury.</strong>&nbsp;Traumatic brain injuries, brain tumors, strokes, HIV
                and some brain diseases such as Parkinson&rsquo;s, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia can sometimes cause
                psychosis.</li>
              <li><strong>Mental health conditions.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes psychosis is a symptom of a condition like
                schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or depression.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>A diagnosis identifies an illness; symptoms are components of an illness. Health care providers draw on
              information from medical and family history and a physical examination to diagnose someone. If causes such
              as a brain tumor, infection or epilepsy are ruled out,&nbsp;a mental illness might be the reason.</p>
            <p>If the cause is related to a mental health condition, early diagnosis and treatment provide the best hope
              of recovery. Research shows that the earlier people experiencing psychosis receive treatment, the better
              their long-term quality of life.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <h3>Early or first-episode psychosis</h3>
            <p>Early treatment of psychosis, especially during the first episode, leads to the best outcomes.</p>
            <p>Research has shown significant success using a treatment approach called Coordinated Specialty Care
              (CSC).
              CSC uses a team of health professionals and specialists who work with a person to create a personal
              treatment plan based on life goals while involving family members as much as possible.</p>
            <p>CSC has the following key components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Case management</li>
              <li>Family support and education</li>
              <li>Psychotherapy</li>
              <li>Medication management</li>
              <li>Supported education and employment</li>
              <li>Peer support</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SAMHSA maintains an Early Serious
              Mental Illness (ESMI) Treatment Locator as a source of information for family members who are
              seeking
              CSC programs in the US. Portions of their website are available in Spanish.</p>
            <h3>Psychosis treatment</h3>
            <p>Traditional treatment for psychosis involves psychotherapy andmedication.
              Several types of therapy have successfully helped individuals learn to manage their condition. In
              addition,
              medication targets symptoms and helps reduce their impact.</p>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>Psychosis can be related to several mental health conditions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
              <li>Schizoaffective Disorder</li>
              <li>Schizophrenia</li>
              <li>Substance use disorders / Dual Diagnosis</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">Schizoaffective Disorder</h1>
            <p>Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized primarily by symptoms of
              schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as mania and
              depression.</p>
            <p>Many people with schizoaffective disorder are often incorrectly diagnosed at first with bipolar disorder
              or
              schizophrenia.&nbsp;Because schizoaffective disorder is less well-studied than the other two conditions,
              many interventions are borrowed from their treatment approaches.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Schizoaffective is relatively rare, with a lifetime prevalence of only&nbsp;0.3%. Men and women
              experience
              schizoaffective disorder at the same rate, but men often develop the illness at an earlier age.
              Schizoaffective disorder can be managed effectively&nbsp;with medication and therapy. Co-occurring
              substance
              use disorders are a serious risk and require integrated treatment.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of schizoaffective disorder can be severe and need to be monitored closely. Depending on the
              type of mood disorder diagnosed, depression or&nbsp;bipolar disorder, people will&nbsp;experience
              different&nbsp;symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hallucinations, which are&nbsp;seeing or hearing things that aren&rsquo;t there.</li>
              <li>Delusions, which are false, fixed beliefs that are held&nbsp;regardless of
                contradictory&nbsp;evidence.
              </li>
              <li>Disorganized thinking. A person may switch very quickly from one topic to another or provide answers
                that are completely unrelated.</li>
              <li>Depressed mood. If a person has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder depressive type they will
                experience feelings of sadness, emptiness, feelings of worthlessness or other symptoms of depression.
              </li>
              <li>Manic behavior. If a person&nbsp;has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder:&nbsp;bipolar type
                they will experience feelings of euphoria, racing thoughts, increased risky behavior and other symptoms
                of
                mania.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of schizoaffective disorder is unknown. A combination of causes&nbsp;may contribute to
              the
              development of schizoaffective disorder.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics.</strong>&nbsp;Schizoaffective disorder tends to run in families. This does not mean
                that if a relative has an illness, you will absolutely get it. But it does mean that there is a greater
                chance of you developing the illness.</li>
              <li><strong>Brain chemistry and structure.</strong>&nbsp;Brain function and structure may be different in
                ways that science is only beginning to understand. Brain scans are helping to advance research in this
                area.</li>
              <li><strong>Stress.</strong> Stressful events such as a death in the family, end of a marriage or loss of
                a
                job can trigger symptoms or an onset of the illness.</li>
              <li><strong>Drug use.</strong> Psychoactive drugs such as LSD have been linked to the development of
                schizoaffective disorder.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Schizoaffective disorder can be difficult to diagnose because it has symptoms of both schizophrenia and
              either depression or bipolar disorder. There are two major types of schizoaffective disorder: bipolar type
              and depressive type.&nbsp;To be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder a person must have the following
              symptoms.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A period during which there is a major mood disorder, either depression or mania, that occurs at the
                same time that symptoms of schizophrenia are present.</li>
              <li>Delusions or hallucinations for two or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode.</li>
              <li>Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total
                duration
                of the illness.</li>
              <li>The abuse of drugs or a medication are not responsible for the symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Schizoaffective disorder is treated and managed in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Medications,
                including&nbsp;mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications and antidepressants</li>
              <li>Psychotherapy,
                such as&nbsp;cognitive behavioral therapy or family-focused therapy</li>
              <li><strong>Self-management strategies and education</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>A person with schizoaffective disorder may have additional mental health conditions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anxiety disorders
              </li>
              <li>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
              <li>Attention-deficit hyperactivity
                disorder (ADHD)</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">Schizophrenia</h1>
            <p>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with a person&rsquo;s ability to think clearly,
              manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. It is a complex, long-term medical illness. The
              exact
              prevalence of schizophrenia is difficult to measure, but estimates range from 0.25% to
              0.64%
              of U.S. adults. Although schizophrenia can occur at any age, the average age of onset tends to be in the
              late teens to the early 20s for men, and the late 20s to early 30s for women. It is uncommon for
              schizophrenia to be diagnosed in a person younger than 12 or older than 40. It is possible to live well
              with
              schizophrenia.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>It can be difficult to diagnose schizophrenia in teens. This is because the first signs can include a
              change of friends, a drop in grades, sleep problems, and irritability&mdash;common and nonspecific
              adolescent behavior. Other factors include isolating oneself and withdrawing from others, an increase in
              unusual thoughts and suspicions, and a family history of psychosis. In young people who develop
              schizophrenia, this stage of the disorder is called the &quot;prodromal&quot; period.</p>
            <p>With any condition, it&#39;s essential to get a comprehensive medical evaluation in order to obtain the
              best diagnosis. For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, some of the following symptoms are present in the
              context
              of reduced functioning for a least 6 months:</p>
            <p><strong>Hallucinations.&nbsp;</strong>These include&nbsp;a person hearing voices, seeing things, or
              smelling things others can&rsquo;t perceive. The hallucination is very real to the person experiencing it,
              and it may be very confusing for a loved one to witness. The voices in the hallucination can be critical
              or
              threatening. Voices may involve people that are known or unknown to the person hearing them.</p>
            <p><strong>Delusions.</strong>&nbsp;These are false beliefs that don&rsquo;t change even when the person who
              holds them is presented with new ideas or facts. People who have delusions often also have problems
              concentrating, confused thinking, or the sense that their thoughts are blocked.</p>
            <p><strong>Negative symptoms</strong> are ones that diminish a person&rsquo;s abilities. Negative symptoms
              often include being emotionally flat or speaking in a dull, disconnected way. People with the negative
              symptoms may be unable to start or follow through with activities, show little interest in life, or
              sustain
              relationships. Negative symptoms are sometimes confused with clinical depression.</p>
            <p><b>Cognitive issues/disorganized thinking</b>. People with the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia often
              struggle to remember things, organize their thoughts or complete tasks. Commonly, people with
              schizophrenia
              have anosognosia or &ldquo;lack of
              insight.&rdquo; This means the person is unaware that he has the illness, which can make treating or
              working
              with him much more challenging.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Research suggests that schizophrenia may have several possible causes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Genetics</strong>. Schizophrenia isn&rsquo;t caused by just one genetic variation, but a
                complex
                interplay of genetics and environmental influences. Heredity does play a strong
                role&mdash;your&nbsp;likelihood of developing schizophrenia is more than&nbsp;six&nbsp;times higher if
                you
                have a close relative, such as a parent or sibling, with the disorder</li>
              <li><strong>Environment.</strong> Exposure to viruses or malnutrition before birth, particularly in the
                first and second trimesters has been shown to increase the risk of&nbsp;schizophrenia. Recent research
                also suggests a relationship between autoimmune disorders and the development of psychosis.&nbsp;</li>
              <li><strong>Brain chemistry.</strong> Problems with certain brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters
                called dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. Neurotransmitters allow brain cells to
                communicate with each other. Networks of neurons are likely involved as well.</li>
              <li><strong>Substance use.</strong> Some studies have suggested that taking mind-altering drugs during
                teen
                years and young adulthood can increase the risk of schizophrenia. A growing body of evidence indicates
                that smoking marijuana increases the risk of psychotic incidents and the risk of ongoing psychotic
                experiences. The younger and more frequent the use, the greater the risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing schizophrenia is not easy. Sometimes using drugs, such as methamphetamines or LSD, can cause a
              person to have schizophrenia-like symptoms.&nbsp;The difficulty of diagnosing this illness is compounded
              by
              the fact that many people who are diagnosed do not believe they have it. Lack of awareness is a common
              symptom of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and greatly complicates treatment.</p>
            <p>While there is no single physical or lab test that can diagnosis schizophrenia, a health care provider
              who
              evaluates the symptoms and the course of a person&#39;s illness over six months can help ensure a correct
              diagnosis. The health care provider must rule out other factors such as brain tumors, possible medical
              conditions and other psychiatric diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder.</p>
            <p>To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must have two or more of the following symptoms occurring
              persistently in the context of reduced functioning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delusions</li>
              <li>Hallucinations</li>
              <li>Disorganized speech</li>
              <li>Disorganized or catatonic behavior</li>
              <li>Negative symptoms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Delusions or hallucinations alone can often be enough to lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
              Identifying
              it as early as possible greatly improves a person&rsquo;s chances of managing the illness, reducing
              psychotic episodes, and recovering. People who receive good care during their first psychotic episode are
              admitted to the hospital less often, and may require less time to control symptoms than those who
              don&rsquo;t receive immediate help. The literature on the role of medicines early in treatment is
              evolving,
              but we do know that psychotherapy is essential.</p>
            <p>People can describe symptoms in a variety of ways. How a person describes symptoms often depends on the
              cultural lens she is looking through. African Americans and Latinos are more likely to be misdiagnosed,
              potentially&nbsp;due to differing cultural perspectives&nbsp;or structural barriers. Any person who has
              been
              diagnosed with schizophrenia should try to work with a health care professional that understands his or
              her
              cultural background and shares the same expectations for treatment.</p>
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for schizophrenia, but it can be treated and managed in several ways.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Antipsychotic
                medications</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Psychotherapy</strong>, such
                as cognitive behavioral therapy and assertive community treatment and supportive therapy</li>
              <li><strong>Self-management strategies and education</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Conditions</h2>
            <p>People with schizophrenia may have additional illnesses. These may include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Substance use disorders/ Dual Diagnosis</li>
              <li>Posttraumatic stress disorder&nbsp;(PTSD)</li>
              <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder&nbsp;(OCD)</li>
              <li>Major depressive
                disorder </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Successfully treating schizohprenia almost always improves these related illnesses. And successful
              treatment of substance misuse, PTSD or OCD usually improves the symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>
